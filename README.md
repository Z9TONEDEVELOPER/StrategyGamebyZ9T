## **P.S.** 📝

I spent around **30 hours** developing this game, implementing various mechanics such as building, object management, AI for cars, and dynamic weather effects. 🌟 While the game is not yet complete, I’ve decided to leave it as an **open-source project** so that anyone can take it, build upon it, and potentially release their own full-fledged project on various gaming platforms. 🚀

This project is my **first step** into the world of game development, and I hope it serves as a useful example for aspiring developers. 💡 Good luck to everyone exploring and improving my project! 🎉 

In the future, I plan to continue developing **open-source games** and deepening my knowledge of Unity. Stay tuned for my upcoming projects! 🔥
